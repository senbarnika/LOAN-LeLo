_**Loan Approval & Eligibility Prediction Using Machine Learning**_

The  project leverages machine learning algorithms to automate and predict loan approval and eligibility based on various applicant features like income, credit history, marital status, etc. 
This project is designed to help financial institutions streamline the loan approval process, reduce manual work, and enhance decision-making accuracy.</br>

Loans are critical in today's economy, providing individuals with the capital they need to meet their personal, educational, or business goals.
